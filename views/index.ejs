<!-- This is my movie database home page. Here I will include a list of movies from TMDB like the current movies. Would it be easier to hard code these movies and maybe include my top 9 favourite movies? Either way, this page shoul include the movie poster, title, and release date for the movie. The user should be able to click on these posters and be brought to the movie details page (movie.ejs) for that movie. There should also be a search form where the users input GETs the DETAILS from TMDB database using the API-->

      These are my all time favourite movies. If I was stranded on a desert island I could watch these over and over and over again and never get bored. In fact I already know one of these movies by heart. Search The Movie Database for all the juicy details about your desert island picks.
